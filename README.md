- ðŸ”­ Hi, Iâ€™m Rishav Bhurtel, a skilled software engineer with expertise in Python, SQL, AWS, and data analysis. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive business insights and enhance customer experiences. With hands-on experience developing data-driven strategies and automating data pipelines, I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to deliver optimized solutions.

I bring a blend of technical expertise and business acumen from my Master of Technology in Data Science and my ongoing MBA studies, which help me approach challenges from both a technical and strategic perspective.

Currently, I am looking to join a dynamic team where I can further contribute to data-driven solutions, optimize system performance, and help businesses unlock the potential of their data.

Feel free to explore my projects, connect with me, or collaborate on exciting new ideas!
